I am dedicated to building reliable and top-quality software.

My interest lies in taking a functional programming approach to tame the complexity of software engineering. This includes the use of strong static typing, pure functions, and high-level abstractions.

Studying the functional programming language Haskell has led me to explore abstract algebra and category theory.

Currently, I am exploring the use of category theory to understand and generalize data structures.
